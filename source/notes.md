### The Habits of Effective Development Teams

### 1. automate the easy things
The first thing effective teams need to automate is testing, without automated tests of applications in development
all other efforts will be in vain.

### 2. codify development practices
Style guides and conventions used by our company
### 3. continually sharpen your tools
Seek out interesting problems. Bring the pain forward.
### 4. practice pairing
Spread knowledge, collaborate to expand your skills and mentor others simultaneously. Everyone on the team brings value.
### 5. code reviews
Two brains and four eyeballs on every commit, after automated tests and before deployment.
### 6. pull-based development
Let developers pull tasks from the queue. If they don't, then assign them, but find out who has initiative through practice. Create a culture of accountability and pride of craft.
### 7. pay off technical debt during feature development
Improve existing code that is _near_ the features you are developing.
### 8. it is ok to take a moment to clear your mind
If you are grinding and getting nowhere, go rest your mind, close your eyes, and breathe. Stay fresh, don't let fatigue introduce bugs.
### 9. play well with the business team and clients
Accept that this is not an academic setting, it is a business. Let the business be a business, not a hackathon.
### 10. develop just enough architecture process
Identify variance or lack thereof, automate as much of your infrastructure as you can, put everythng else in User Data
### 11. performance is a first-class citizen
Don't sacrifice performance to save a couple of minutes. Think about what you are doing, before you commit.
### 12. manage the noise of production systems
Messaging system overload is real, human beings ignore repetitive and meaningless notifications, make sure any push notifications or alert messages are a call to action, not merely informational cruft. If you push too much people will ignore it, which is almost worse than no notifications at all.
