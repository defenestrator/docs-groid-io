## Generalized standards.

This guide exists to provide a marginally sane set of defaults for building software applications.

### The Basics

- We use Git, there will be no push-to-master deployments on the groid-io repository.
  - Administrators may push to Master for this documentation site, but all others must submit a Pull Request.
- Contributions MUST use UTF-8 Character Encoding for source code files.
- Contributions MUST use Unix Newlines
- Contributions MUST use Soft Tabs

### Coding Style Ethics
- We are all mere humans, and we will have to maintain your code someday. Be nice to your fellow developers.
- Readability is important, please be consistent.
- Maintainability is important, don't get unnecessarily fancy.
- Focus on suitability to the task at hand, don't optimize prematurely. Conversely, don't ignore performance.
